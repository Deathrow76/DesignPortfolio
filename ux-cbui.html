    <h1>Project Overview</h1>
    <p>Rackspace has great products and no one questions their Fanatical Support for them, but their customer portals and 
        billing portals didn’t reflect that. These were designed over 5 years ago, back when Rackspace didn’t have people 
        in UX positions. Sure there were web designers that worked on rackspace.com but not on development teams that built 
        out these portals. Rackspace had a team that used Bootstrap 1.0 and styled it in Rackspace colors for dev teams to use 
        to build with but to a customer with a dedicated account and a cloud account it looked like 2 different companies. 
        There wasn’t a style guide with design patterns to follow when they built these. The customer didn’t have a 
        seamless experience. Business finally listened to the customers and opened up a UX team and hired a well known person 
        in the UX community to direct the department. To make a long story short my dev team received a illustrator file of the 
        1st draft of the new design system. We were put to task to create the new Customer Billing User Interface (CBUI). 
        We were pioneers in the company for this new look and customer experience.

    <h1>Competitive Analysis</h1>

    <p>We took a deep dive into the way AWS and Google Cloud Platform handle their billing. We cherry picked what we thought was their 
        best features and came up with a dashboard design that would fit our customers. The invoice details was what Rackspace was 
        lacking and what we really focused on.

    <p>After doing competitive analysis on our competitors it was time to put lo-fi wires together.
        We decided a dashboard for billing would be the best approach. Three different designs were presented to 5 customers with 
        different personas: resellers, billing administrators and business owners.

        <p>
        We captured all the feedback based upon what 
        they would expect to see when looking at their billing. We used Mural for card sorting and designed our new wires against them. 
        Our team then came up with hi-fi wires with clickable walkthroughs to present to dedicated and cloud customers again.

    <h1>Customer Billing is Born</h1>
    <p>This is our final prototype that is currently in production. 10 months in the making. Research and information gathering, 
        concept creation and iterative design, visual update and development. Very rewarding to see a concept that is brought to 
        life and out in production providing great value and experience to our customers.
