        <h1>Project Overview</h1>
    <p>Rackspace needed a better way to let Rackers donate to the Thanksgiving food drive and there wasn’t an online portal to get 
       the other Rackspace offices to donate. 
    <p>
       I created a website that would let Rackers in offices country wide and the London office to donate and track the progress 
       of the boxes donated.

        <h1>Content</h1>
    <p>I reached out to the Rack Gives Back team to get content they had from previous food drives like pictures, the logo, and copy. 
        I also wanted to understand what they wanted to get out of the site. After gathering all the content and proposed requirements I 
        designed the site.

        <h1>Design</h1>
    <p>I wanted the site to behave like an informational brochure that was dynamic in the way it tracked the boxes bought so as a 
        company we could see how close we were to the goal. I leveraged Rackspace’s payment form web application that we used for 
        customers to make secure donations on the site. This also was used to track the progress of the donations by location.
