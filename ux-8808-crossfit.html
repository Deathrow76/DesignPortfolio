        <h1>Project Overview</h1>
    <p>Rackspace has a great cross fit community that needed a website to boast itâ€™s awesome outdoor facility and its members. 
        Being a part of CrossFit and to be recognized officially they must have a web presence. RaxFit leadership came to me for help in this task. 
    </p>

        <h1>Content</h1>
    <p>After meeting with RaxFit leadership I gathered all the information they wanted to present on the site. 
        They also wanted me to come up with a logo and to do all of the photography for the site. I was glad to help out on this.
