    <h1>Project Overview</h1>
    <p>Support and Billing Rackers needed a better tool to give customers credits and adjustments.  
The previous tool was outdated and not user friendly. That much was clear. It’s design was beginning to show its age and wasn’t useful 
for cloud customer adjustments. For cloud customer adjustments and credits had to be done manually. This took a ton of time for Rackers 
to get these done. Business came to me with requirements to roll out a tool that will be featured on the company’s new internal 
framework called Encore.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h1>Why am I building this?</h1>
    <p>To simply put it, I needed to help our customers faster with adjustments. Giving frontline Support Rackers a better tool to speed up the process 
        will make the customers happy and free up Rackers time to do more run of the business tasks.

    <p>Once our BA gathered all of the requirements from a week long kaizen meeting, I was tasked to come up with workflows. 
        Adjustment and credit tool (ACT) is a complex orchestration workflow engine in a way. At the surface you might picture or 
        think that it is just a typical form that you see everyday. There are multiple backend systems and databases that it has to 
        pull information. Also there is a Racker’s role to consider, threshold amounts and approval groups. To give some context I have 
        attached an <a href="https://invis.io/8U551EG92" target="_blank" style="color:#FF4081">Invision link</a> to show the workflows.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h1>The Design</h1>
    <p>After I hammered out the workflows it was time to present some wireframes. I used a program called OmniGraffle to create low fidelity 
        wireframes to show an overview of the ACT form to business. Once the business approves the wires or has feedback, I edit and 
        meet again with business to get them to sign off on them. Within the form there is complex components associated with the 
        creation of the request. For example depending on your role i.e a Support Racker or a Billing Racker you will see different 
        form fields. I presented multiple use cases for each role. To begin with the Racker has to enter an account number. Once the 
        account number is validated a dedicated or a cloud request is initiated. As the Racker fills out the form, one of the first 
        inputs is the Reason Code field. This field drives the request and has a effect on what other fields are shown and populated. 
        After the request form is filled out then there is a detail view showing what was in the form request.  I then open up either 
        Photoshop, Illustrator or Sketch to layout hi fidelity wireframes complete with Invision walkthroughs.
