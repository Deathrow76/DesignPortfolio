        <h1>Project Overview</h1>
    <p>Rackspace needed a website to recruit college students for a summer time internship.This internship 
        offers high school and college students the opportunity of real world experience in the fast paced 
        world of information technology. Interns will enhance their problem solving, team building, and 
        communication and see firsthand how one of the most sought-after companies in the country is to work for.

        <h1>Content and Design</h1>
    <p> 
        I came up with the layout concept, all of the photography, graphic design and logo. I worked with other 
        Rackers to come up with the copy and testimonials. I used Bootstrap as the framework.
