    <h1>Project Overview</h1>
    <p>Support and Billing Rackers needed a better tool to give customers credits and adjustments.  
The previous tool was outdated and not user friendly. That much was clear. It’s design was beginning to show its age and wasn’t useful 
for cloud customer adjustments. For cloud customer adjustments and credits had to be done manually. This took a ton of time for Rackers 
to get these done. Business came to me with requirements to roll out a tool that will be featured on the company’s new internal 
framework called Encore.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h1>Why am I building this?</h1>
    <p>To simply put it, I needed to help our customers faster with adjustments. Giving frontline Support Rackers a better tool to speed up the process 
        will make the customers happy and free up Rackers time to do more run of the business tasks.

    </div> 
    <br>
    <p>Once our BA gathered all of the requirements from a week long kaizen meeting, I was tasked to come up with workflows. 
        Adjustment and credit tool (ACT) is a complex orchestration workflow engine in a way. At the surface you might picture or 
        think that it is just a typical form that you see everyday. There are multiple backend systems and databases that it has to 
        pull information. Also there is a Racker’s role to consider, threshold amounts and approval groups. To give some context I have 
        attached an <a href="https://invis.io/8U551EG92" target="_blank" style="color:#FF4081">Invision link</a> to show the workflows.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h1>The Design</h1>
    <p>After I hammered out the workflows it was time to present some wireframes. I used a program called OmniGraffle to create low fidelity 
        wireframes to show an overview of the ACT form to business. Once the business approves the wires or has feedback, I edit and 
        meet again with business to get them to sign off on them. Within the form there is complex components associated with the 
        creation of the request. For example depending on your role i.e a Support Racker or a Billing Racker you will see different 
        form fields. I presented multiple use cases for each role. To begin with the Racker has to enter an account number. Once the 
        account number is validated a dedicated or a cloud request is initiated. As the Racker fills out the form, one of the first 
        inputs is the Reason Code field. This field drives the request and has a effect on what other fields are shown and populated. 
        After the request form is filled out then there is a detail view showing what was in the form request.  I then open up either 
        Photoshop, Illustrator or Sketch to layout hi fidelity wireframes complete with Invision walkthroughs.

    <h1>Project Overview</h1>
    <p>Rackspace has great products and no one questions their Fanatical Support for them, but their customer portals and 
        billing portals didn’t reflect that. These were designed over 5 years ago, back when Rackspace didn’t have people 
        in UX positions. Sure there were web designers that worked on rackspace.com but not on development teams that built 
        out these portals. Rackspace had a team that used Bootstrap 1.0 and styled it in Rackspace colors for dev teams to use 
        to build with but to a customer with a dedicated account and a cloud account it looked like 2 different companies. 
        There wasn’t a style guide with design patterns to follow when they built these. The customer didn’t have a 
        seamless experience. Business finally listened to the customers and opened up a UX team and hired a well known person 
        in the UX community to direct the department. To make a long story short my dev team received a illustrator file of the 
        1st draft of the new design system. I was put to task to create the new Customer Billing User Interface (CBUI). 
        I was a pioneer in the company for this new look and customer experience.

         <span class="image-txt">Competitive analysis of AWS & Google.</span>
    </div>
    <p>I took a deep dive into the way AWS and Google Cloud Platform handle their billing. I cherry picked what I thought was their 
        best features and came up with a dashboard design that would fit our customers. The invoice details was what Rackspace was 
        lacking and what I really focused on.

    </div>     
        <p>
    <p>After doing competitive analysis on our competitors it was time to put lo-fiedilty wires together.
        I decided a dashboard for billing would be the best approach. Three different designs were presented to 5 customers with 
        different personas: resellers, billing administrators and business owners.

    </div>     
        <p>
        I captured all the feedback based upon what 
        they would expect to see when looking at their billing. I used Mural for card sorting and designed our new wires against them. 
        Our team then came up with hi-fi wires with clickable walkthroughs to present to dedicated and cloud customers again.

    <h1>Customer Billing is Born</h1>
    <p>This is our final prototype that is currently in production. 10 months in the making. Research and information gathering, 
        concept creation and iterative design, visual update and development. Very rewarding to see a concept that is brought to 
        life and out in production providing great value and experience to our customers.

        <h1>Project Overview</h1>
    <p>Rackspace needed a better way to let Rackers donate to the Thanksgiving food drive and there wasn’t an online portal to get 
       the other Rackspace offices to donate. 
    <p>
       I created a website that would let Rackers in offices country wide and the London office to donate and track the progress 
       of the boxes donated.
    </p>
    <br>
        <h1>Content</h1>
    <p>I reached out to the Rack Gives Back team to get content they had from previous food drives like pictures, the logo, and copy. 
        I also wanted to understand what they wanted to get out of the site. After gathering all the content and proposed requirements I 
        designed the site.

        company we could see how close we were to the goal. I leveraged Rackspace’s payment form web application that we used for 
        customers to make secure donations on the site. This also was used to track the progress of the donations by location.
