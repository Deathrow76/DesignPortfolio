                    <h3>UX / UI Designer Bridging the Gap Between Design and Development.</h3>

                    I am just another creative guy who can build a meaningful creative experience for you! While interaction and user flow design
                    are some of my core strengths, you'll often find me participating in a variety of cross-disciplinary
                    activities including user research, stakeholder interviews, and front end development. <br>                    My identity as a user experience (UX) designer is grounded in a capacity for cognitive empathy, a deep
                    interest in how people connect through verbal and visual communication.<br>
                    <br> I love creating polished designs and engaging interactions. I have a traditional design background
                    with the technical chops for today's demanding user. Graphic design, photography and 3D modeling is still
                    something I love to do. I really look forward to collaborating with you.
